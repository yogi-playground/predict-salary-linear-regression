## Salary Predictor Using ML Linear Regression Model
**#Problem Statement:**

You work in XYZ Company as a Python Data Scientist. The company officials have collected some data on salaries based on year of experience and wish for you to create a model from it.

**#Dataset: Salary data.csv**

**#Tasks To Be Performed:**
*  Load the dataset using pandas.
*  Extract data from the years experience column into a variable named X.
*  Extract data from the salary column into a variable named Y.
*  Divide the dataset into two parts for training and testing in 66% and 33% proportion.
*  Create and train a Linear Regression Model on the training set.
*  Make predictions based on the testing set using the trained model.
*  Check the performance by calculating the RÂ² score of the model.
